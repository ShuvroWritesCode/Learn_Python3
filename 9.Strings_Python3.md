## Strings

Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation ' ', or double quotation " ", or even three single quotations ''' '''.

'hello' / "hello" / '''hello''' are all same things.

    print('string')
    print("string")
    print('''string''')

Output:
> string
> 
> string
> 
> string

### Assigning String to a Variable

Same as assigning any variable in Python...

    a = 'character'
    b = "Bangladesh"
    c = '''John's book'''
    
    print(a)
    print(b)
    print(c)
    
    print(type(a))
    print(type(b))
    print(type(c))
    
Output:
>character
>
>Bangladesh
>
>John's book
>
><class 'str'>
>
><class 'str'>
>
><class 'str'>

### Multiline Strings

What if I want to use strings with multiple lines?
Here's how we do it,

    text = '''Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    And sorry I could not travel both
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    And looked down one as far as I could
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;'''

    print(text)
    
We use three single quotations on both side of the string.

Output:
>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
>
>And sorry I could not travel both
>
>And be one traveler, long I stood
>
>And looked down one as far as I could
>
>To where it bent in the undergrowth;
   
or,

    text = """Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    And sorry I could not travel both
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    And looked down one as far as I could
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;"""

    print(text)

Three double quotations also do the same job.

Output:
>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
>
>And sorry I could not travel both
>
>And be one traveler, long I stood
>
>And looked down one as far as I could
>
>To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Three double quotations also do the same job.
Note that there should be no indentation in between the multiline strings.

### Strings are Arrays

Python does not have a character data type like C/C++, a single character is a string with a length of 1 in Python. Square brackets is used to access elements of the string.

    string = "Python for beginners"
    print(string[0])
    
Like in other popular languages, in python the index of a string starts from 0.

Output:
> P

    string = "Python for beginners"
    print(string[1])
    
Output:
> y

and so on...

If you want to print any string from index x to y, we do it this way.

    string = "Python for beginners"
    print(string[0:6])
    
Though the range is specified as [0:6] but character in index 6 won't be printed. So, the range is basically [0] to [6-1].

Output:
> Python

Another example,

    string = "Python for beginners"
    print(string[11:16])
   
Output:
> begin

If you write a snippet something like,

    string = "Python for beginners"
    print(string[11:9])

So here the ending index is less that the start index. 

Output:
>
>
>Process finished with exit code 0

There will not be any error but there will not be any output either.

### String Length

To get the length of a string, python has built-in function called len().
The len() function returns the length of a string as an integer.

    string = "Python for beginners"
    print(len(string))
    print(type(len(string)))
    
Output:
>20           
>
><class 'int'>

len() function also counts the white spaces.
