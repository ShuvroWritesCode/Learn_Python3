## Collections in Python (Arrays)
In the Python programming language, there are four different collection data types.
- list
- tuple
- set
- dictionary

A list is an organized and changeable collection of items. 
Tuple is an ordered and unchanging collection. 
A set is an unsorted, unchangeable, and unindexed collection. 
A dictionary is an ordered and changing collection . Set items cannot be changed, however you may delete and/or add things at any time.

**Dictionaries are now organized in Python version 3.7. Dictionaries in Python 3.6 and before are not sorted.

Understanding the attributes of a collection type is necessary for selecting one. Choosing the proper data type for a given data collection might result in meaning being retained, it increases software security as well as saving time.
