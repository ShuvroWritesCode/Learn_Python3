## More Strings

In python one can check whether any word or letter is present in the string or not.
Let's check if there is any 'for' word in the txt string below. This checking always return a boolean value.

    txt = "Python for beginners!"
    print("for" in txt)
    
Output:
> True

    txt = "Python for beginners!"
    print("easy" in txt)
    
Output:
> False

This is case sensitive if you search for 'For' instead of 'for' it will show False.

    txt = "Python for beginners!"
    print("For" in txt)
    
Output:
> False

Again if you search a phrase or a character like 'fo' of for, it will be true as that part of string is present.

    txt = "Python for beginners!"
    print("Pyt" in txt)
    
Output:
> True

You can also check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present, use the keyword 'not in' for it.

    txt = "Python for beginners!"
    print("compiler" not in txt)
    
Output:
> True

You can also build a condition out of 'in' and 'not in'

    txt = "Python for beginners!"
    if "Python" in txt:
      print("Yes, 'Python' is present.")
    else:
      print("No, 'Python' is not present in the txt.")
      
Output:
> Yes, 'Python' is present.

    txt = "Python for beginners!"
    if "JavaScript" not in txt:
      print("Yes, 'JavaScript' is not present.")
    else:
      print("No, 'JavaScript' is present in the txt.")

Output:
> Yes, 'JavaScript' is not present.

### Looping through a string

Using a for loop, we can loop through the characters in a string.

    for x in "banana":
      print(x)

Output:
> b
> 
> a
> 
> n
> 
> a
> 
> n
> 
> a
