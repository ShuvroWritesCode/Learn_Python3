## Operatos in Python

Python has different kinds of operators and to me, the number of operators in Python is larger than any other popular languages.
A list of classifications of operators in python is given.

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators
- Bitwise operators

----------

### Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication etc. requires these operators. 

| Operator | Name | Example | Return Type | Learn More |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| + | Addition | x+y | int | [Addition Operator](https://blog.finxter.com/python-addition-operator/) |
| - | Subtraction | x-y | int | [Subtraction Operator](https://blog.finxter.com/python-subtraction-operator/) |
| * | Multiplication | x*y | int | [Multiplication Operator](https://blog.finxter.com/python-multiplication-operator/) |
| / | Division | x/y | float | [Division Operator](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-are-division-operators-in-python) |
| % | Modulus | x%y | int | [Modulus Operator](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-modulo-operator-in-python/) |
| ** | Exponential | x**y | int | [Exponential Operator](https://blog.finxter.com/python-exponent-operator/) |
| // | Floor Division | x//y | int | [Floor Division Operator](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-are-division-operators-in-python) |

### Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Example |
|----------|---------|
| = |	x = 5	|	
| += | x += 3 |
| -= | x -= 3 |	
| *= | x *= 3 |
| /= | x /= 3 |
| %= | x %= 3 |
| //= |	x //= 3	|
| **=	| x **= 3	|
| &=	| x &= 3 |
| l-= | x l= 3	|
| ^= | x ^= 3 |
| >>=	| x >>= 3 |
| <<=	| x <<= 3 |

### Relational Operators
Relational operators are used to compare two values.

| Operator | Name |	Example	|
|----------|------|---------|
| == | Equal | x == y	|
| != | Not equal | x != y |	
| > | Greater than | x > y |	
| < | Less than | x < y	|
| >= | Greater than or equal to | x >= y |
| <= | Less than or equal to | x <= y |

### Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

| Operator | Use Case | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| and |	Returns True if both statements are true | x < 5 and  x < 10 |
| or | Returns True if one of the statements is true | x < 5 or x < 4	|
| not	| Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true | not(x < 5 and x < 10) |

### Identity Operators
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

| Operator | Use Case | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| is 	 | Returns True if both variables are the same | x is y |
| is not | Returns True if both variables are different |	x is not y |

### Membership Operators
As the name says, it shows if a sequence is member of another sequence or not.

| Operator | Use Case | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| in | Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in other variable | x in y |
| not in | Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in other variable |	x not in y |

### Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to compare binary numbers.

| Operator | Use Case | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| & |	AND |	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1 |
| l |	OR | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1 |
| ^ |	XOR |	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1 |
| ~ |	NOT |	Inverts all the bits |
| << | Zero fill left shift | Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off |
| >> |	Signed right shift | Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off |
