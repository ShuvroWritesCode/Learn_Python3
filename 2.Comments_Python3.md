## Comments in Python

Comments are used to explain any code. It makes the code more readable. 
Similar to any other language, in python we can write both single and multi-line commenting. 
For single line comment we use # before the sentence to comment. 
    
    #This is a single line comment.
	
For multi-line comments python requires 3 double quotations """x"""

    """
    	This is an example of multi-line comment.
    	This is an example of multi-line comment.
    	This is an example of multi-line comment.
    """
