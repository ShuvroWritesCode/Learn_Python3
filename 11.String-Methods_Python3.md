## String Methods

There are a lot of built-in method for strings in python. The most used ones are,
- upper()
- lower()
- strip()
- replace()
- split()

Let's learn about use of each methods.

### upper()

upper() is used to turn each character of a string to upper case.

    str = 'python for beginners'
    print(str.upper())

Output:
> PYTHON FOR BEGINNERS

    str1 = 'PyThOn'
    str2 = 'PYTHON'
    print(str1.upper())
    print(str2.upper())

Output:
> PYTHON
> 
> PYTHON

So, it doesn't care if the letters are already in upper case.

## lower()

lower() is used to turn each character of a string to lower case.

    str = 'python for beginners'
    print(str.lower())

Output:
> python for beginners

    str1 = 'PyThOn'
    str2 = 'python'
    print(str1.lower())
    print(str2.lower())

Output:
> python
> 
> python

Similar to upper(), this doesn't care if the letters are already in lower cases.

---------------

### strip()

The strip() removes all whitespace from the beginning or the end:

    str = "       Python for beginner!     "
    print(str.strip())
    
Output:
> Python for beginner!

---------------

### Replace String

The replace() is used to replace a character or a set of characters (/string) with another one.

    a = "Python for beginner!"
    print(a.replace("P", "S"))

Output:
> Sython for beginner!

    a = "Python for beginner!"
    print(a.replace("beginner", "Advanced"))

Output:
> Python for Advanced!

----------------

### Split String
split() is used to return a list. You apply a character or string as parameter and it basically split it in two parts.

    a = "Python, Javascript"
    print(a.split(","))
    print(type(a.split(",")))

Output:
> ['Python', ' Javascript']
> 
> <class 'list'>

Another example,

    a = "Python for beginners!"
    print(a.split("for"))
    
Output:
> ['Python ', ' beginners!']

### String Concatenation

To combine, + operator is used in between the strings in Python.

    str1 = "Python"
    str2 = "For"
    str3 = "Beginners!"
    string = str1 + str2 + str3
    string1 = str1 + " " + str2 + " " + str3
    print(string)
    print(string1)

Output:
> PythonForBeginners!
> 
> Python For Beginners!

You can understand why I used + " " between the strings :D

### Escape Characters
Escape character means to write the characters that are usually illegal to be printed.
Like you cannot print something "Python for beginners like "High-schooler's"!". As python won't allow printing double quotations within the double quotes.
So, here of course we can use the triple single quote technique mention [here](https://github.com/ShuvroWritesCode/Learn_Python3/blob/main/1.Syntax-Identation_Python3.md) and the other way is using escape character.

| Characters      | Code |
|-----------------|------|
| Single Quote    | \'   |
| Double Quote    | \"   |
| New Line        | \n   |
| Backslash       | \\   |
| Carriage Return | \r   |
| Tab             | \t   |
| Octal value     | \ooo |
| Hex value       | \xhh |

    str0 = "It\'s great!"
    print(str0)

    str1 = "\"Bangladesh\""
    print(str1) 

    str2 = "Python\nFor\nBeginners!"
    print(str2) 

    str3 = "How can I add a \\ (backslash)?"
    print(str3) 

    str4 = "Hello\rWorld!"
    print(str4) 

    str5 = "Let's add a \t (tab) for indentation,"
    print(str5)

Output:
> It's great!
> 
> "Bangladesh"
> 
> Python
> 
> For
> 
> Beginners!
> 
> How can I add a \ (backslash)?
> 
> World!
> 
> Let's add a 	 (tab) for indentation,
