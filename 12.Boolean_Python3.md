## Boolean in Python

Like any other popular languages, Booleans represent one of two values either True or False.

    print(5 > 4)
    print(5 == 4)
    print(5 < 4)
    
Output:
>True
>
>False
>
>False

Booleans are important for conditional statement since the 'if', 'elif' or 'else' operator execute its code based on the boolean value of the logic inside it.

    a = 50
    b = 100

    if a > b:
      print("a is greater than b")
    elif a == b:
      print("a is equal to b")
    else:
      print("a is not greater than b")
      
Output:
> a is not greater than b

The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and return either True or false.

    print(bool("Casey"))
    print(bool(368))
    
Output:
> True
> 
> True

### Most Values are True
Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content. If strings, integers, list, tuple, set or dictionaries are not empty then they will return true value. In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.

    print(bool("abc"))
    print(bool(123))
    print(bool(["apple", "cherry", "banana"]))
    print(bool(True))
    print(bool(False))
    print(bool(None))
    print(bool(0))
    print(bool(""))
    print(bool(()))
    print(bool([]))
    print(bool({}))

Output:
>True
>
>True
>
>True
>
>True
>
>False
>
>False
>
>False
>
>False
>
>False
>
>False
>
>False

It is a convention to use 'is' prefix before a boolean variable. 
For example,

    bool isActive = 0;
    bool isAdult = 1;
    bool isCommitted = 0;
