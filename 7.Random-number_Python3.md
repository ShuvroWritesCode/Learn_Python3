## Random in Python

Unlike other languages, Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called 'random' that can be used to generate random numbers.

- Use randint() when you want to generate a random number from an inclusive range. randint(start, stop)
- Use randrange() when you want to generate a random number within a range by specifying the increment. randrange(start, stop, step)

Let me show you two different ways to get random integers!

----------

### using randrange()
    import random
    print(random.randrange(1, 10))
   
This snippet of code display a random number between 1 and 9 (not 10) everytime, with default step 1.

----------

### using randint()

    import random
    print(random.randint(1, 10))
    
    # another way
    from random import randint
    print(randint(1, 9))

This snippet also generate random integer from 1 to 9 (including 9) everytime using randint()!
