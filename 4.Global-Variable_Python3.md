## Global Variable

The variable written outside of a function is called global variable. It can be used by both the function and outside of it. For example,

    x = 10
    
    def func():
    print(x)


    func()
    
    print(f"{x} is global")
    
Output:
> 10
>
> 10 is global

In the output first 10 is the output of the func() funtion and later '10 is global' is printed as x is a global variable outside the function here.

Variable written inside a function is called local variable and it cannot be used outside that function.

    def func():
      x = 10
      print(x)

    func()

    print(f"{x} is global")
    
Output:
> NameError: name 'x' is not defined
> 
> 10

Here, we can see NameError exception for print() as it cannot find the variable x, it being a local variable for function func(). Later, 10 is the output for called func() function.

To use any local variable outside of a function, rather to use it globally Python has 'global' keyword. 

    def func():
      global x
      x = 10
      print(x)

    func()
    
    print(f"{x} is global")
    

Output:
> 10
> 
> 10 is global

Since, here global keyword is used before x. That is why instead of being a local variable, x here is a global variable and so print() function is working.
